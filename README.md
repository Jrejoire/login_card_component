This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Technology used:
    - HTML
    - SCSS
    - React-Fontawesome

The structure of the app uses CSS grid.
   
I have set up SASS support with node-sass for create-react-app. You don't need to change any other configuration.
You'll find colors and mixins in the src/containers/scss folder.

The actions from the card component use a simple login logic with usernames and localstorage.

You can preview the deployed app by using the following link http://jrejoire.github.io/login_card_component

Below the main commands from Creat React App:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
